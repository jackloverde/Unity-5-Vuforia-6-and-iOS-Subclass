# Unity-5-Vuforia-6-and-iOS-Subclass
This is a repository for Unity 5.x, Vuforia 6.x and iOS 8.4 to 10.x subclassing example with code.

**Because GitHub has a limit for 100MB for file, i need to upload on BitBucket. Unity and Unity build for XCode is too large!**

Go to BitBucket repo: https://bitbucket.org/jack_loverde/unity-5-vuforia-6-and-ios-native-integration
